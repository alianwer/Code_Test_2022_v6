Positive Aspects:
Namespacing and Structure:
The code uses proper namespacing and follows a reasonable directory structure, which is a good practice for maintaining a clean and organized codebase.

Dependency Injection:
The use of dependency injection in the constructor (function __construct(User $model)) is a good practice as it allows for better testability and flexibility.

Database Interaction:
The code uses Laravel's Eloquent ORM for database interactions, which is a convenient and expressive way to interact with databases.

Areas for Improvement:

Code Duplication:
There is some code duplication. It could be encapsulated in a separate method to avoid redundancy.

Magic Values:
The usage of some magic values (e.g., env('CUSTOMER_ROLE_ID'), env('TRANSLATOR_ROLE_ID')) might lead to issues. It's better to define constants or use configuration files to manage such values. I have refactored the code.

Hardcoded Values:
Some hardcoded values, like 'success' and 'fail', should be replaced with meaningful constants or enums for better readability.

Large Method:
There are several methods which are relatively large and does multiple tasks. It might be beneficial to break it down into smaller, more focused methods to improve readability and maintainability.

Error Handling:
Proper error handling is missing. Adding try-catch blocks or using Laravel's exception handling could enhance the robustness of the code.

Lack of Validation:
The code does not include input validation. Validating user input is crucial to prevent security vulnerabilities. Consider using Laravel's validation features.

Configuration Management:
Directly using env function calls within the code might not be the best practice. Consider using Laravel's configuration files for better organization and flexibility.
